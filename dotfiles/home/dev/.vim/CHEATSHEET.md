# Vim Go IDE Cheatsheet

To view this Cheatsheet in Vim, just hit F1

This is written at a level that should pander to those who have very little vim experience
and still be useful to those who are far more adept at using it.

## Leader Key

The Leader key is set to `,` currently.

So when it's mentions to do Leader + action

You're actually going to hit `, then n` for reference.

You hit the keys in order, not all at once.

## Bindings

You can find all custom bindings in the vimrc

The vimrc can be accessed inside of vim via: Leader + v

### How to Save and Exit vim

Laugh all you want, people still don't know how to do this! :-)

* Hit `esc` then `:` and enter `q` to quit
